Welcome to the home page of our research group!

We are a computational biology lab at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/) proudly affiliated with the State Key Laboratory of Genetics and Development of Complex Phenotypes, the Department of Computational Biology, and [the School of Life Sciences](https://life.fudan.edu.cn/).

Our core mission is to develop and apply cutting-edge bioinformatics methods to decipher the complexities of biology and human diseases. We are tackling challenging questions from multiple angles, with a primary focus on:

Identifying Disease-Associated Genetic Variants: Developing novel algorithms to screen for pathogenic variants in both coding and non-coding regions of the genome.

Clinical and Phenotypic Data Analysis: Creating advanced computational tools for the integrative analysis of clinical and large-scale phenotype data.

Single-Cell Omics: Innovating analytical methods for single-cell data to understand cellular heterogeneity and its clinical implications.

Gene Regulation: Investigating the mechanisms of RNA editing and transcriptional regulation through computational approaches.

Systems Biology: Building models and methods for the analysis of complex biological pathways and networks.

Our ultimate goal is to translate massive biological data into meaningful insights that can advance both fundamental science and precision medicine.
